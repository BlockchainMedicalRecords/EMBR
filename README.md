Supporting the blockchain will be a ledger which records all transactions ever made over the blockchain. Specifically, as a private consortium, we as a group will have control over the information thus ensuring all transaction history can be viewed and private data is not shared. Electronic Medical BlockChain Records (EMBR) will display an itemized bill for hospital visits or assosciated medical expenses and provide users with the option to take care of the co-pay with their linked ethereum wallet. Through a seamless transaction process and candid expense reports, the goal is to minimize administrative pains for those in the medical sector and patients alike.
